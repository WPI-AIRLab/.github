# WPI Adaptive and Intelligent Robotics Lab (AIR Lab)

**For more information, please visit [our homepage](https://wp.wpi.edu/airlab/home/).**

The AIR Lab is located at Unity Hall 200E (2nd Floor) of 27 Boynton Street, Worcester, MA, US. Research at the AIR Lab is focused on robotic systems that can best adapt to unknowns, uncertainties, and changes in the working environments, through real-time perception, planning, learning, and execution in seamless synergy.

## Main Research Areas:
- Continuous Coverage Motion for Constrained Manipulation
- Complex manipulation combining perception, planning, and learning
- Learning object properties through perception and manipulation
- Real-time adaptive motion planning with learning-based optimization
- Semantic SLAM with object recognition and localization
